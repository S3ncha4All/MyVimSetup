# My personal NeoVim - setup

Its based on lazy and uses my personal settings and preferences. I use it in an Ubuntu-Terminal with WSL.
The setup is not yet completed. (Its a journey)


## Further steps to do
- refactor the defaukt example.lua
- Keymappings
- more colorthemes
- telescope customizing
